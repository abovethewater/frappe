# Frapp√©

Template for creating [Express](http://expressjs.com) applications with
[CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org).

Inspired by:
* [skeleton](https://github.com/EtienneLem/skeleton)
* [express-coffee](https://github.com/twilson63/express-coffee)
* [full-stack-nodejs part 1](https://peepcode.com/products/full-stack-nodejs-i)
* [full-stack-nodejs part 2](https://peepcode.com/products/full-stack-nodejs-ii)

## Installation

```sh
$ git clone http://github.com/dweldon/frappe [project-name]
$ cd [project-name] && rm -rf .git && npm install
```

## Commands

### start

To start the server:
```sh
$ npm start
```

For convenience while developing, automatic restarts are provided with:
```sh
$ cake start
```

Additionally, the port and environment variables can be set. The following
example will start the server listening on port 3000 in production mode:
```sh
$ cake -p 3000 -e production start
```

### test

To run the tests:
```sh
$ cake test
```

### update

To update all packages and run [npmedge](https://npmjs.org/package/npmedge):
```sh
$ cake update
```

## Notes

* There are no global dependencies for production. When developing, it is
recommended that CoffeeScript be installed globally so the `cake` command is
available (see above).
* The test and development environments use different port numbers so you can
leave your development server running while testing.
* All modules in the models, controllers, and helpers directories (and
subdirectories) will be automatically required and loaded into `app.locals`. For
example, `app/models/user_model.coffee` will be available as
app.locals.UserModel. This requires that all modules in the aforementioned
directories export a single function which takes `app` as its parameter.
